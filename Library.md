# Library Kata

Build a program which handles the inventory system of a library. It will need to track what books the library has, if they are checked out to a patron, their due date, and any fines. Try to build each user story / feature sequentially.

## Inventory
*As a librarian  
I want to know what titles the library has  
so that I can help my patrons find books to read*
