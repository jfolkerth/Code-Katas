# Library Kata

Build a program which assists in the daily tasks of a library. It will need to track what books the library has, manage the collection, what books are checked out to what patrons, their due dates, and any fines. Try to build each feature sequentially.

## Collection
*As a librarian  
I want to know what titles the library has  
so that I can help my patrons find books to read*  

## Add Books
*As a librarian  
I want to add a book to the library's collection  
so that I can grow my library's offerings*  

## Remove Books
*As a librarian  
I want to remove a book from the library's collection  
so that I can retire damaged books and make way for new offerings*  

## Multiple Copies
*As a patron  
I want the library to stock multiple copies of a book  
so that I don't have to wait so long to read popular titles*  

## Patrons
*As a librarian  
I want to know who holds a library card  
so that I don't let hoodlums make off with my books!*  

## Check Outs
*As a patron  
I want to be able to check out books  
so that I can read them at home*  

## Due Dates
*As a librarian  
I want each checked out book to have a due date  
so that I know when to expect a book back*  

## Fines
*As a librarian  
I want each overdue book to accrue a fine of $0.15 a day  
so that patrons are encouraged to return their books on time*  

## Residency
*As a librarian  
I want to know if a patron is a local resident  
so that I can charge higher fines to those who don't support the library through taxes*  

## Non-Resident Fines
*As a librarian  
I want each overdue book checked out to a non-resident patron to accrue a fine of $0.50 a day  
so that those who don't support the library through taxes have greater incentive to return books on time*  

## Block Additional Checkouts
*As a librarian  
I want to prevent patrons with outstanding fines from checking out additional books  
so that patrons actually pay their fines*  

## Pay Fines
*As a patron  
I want to be able to pay off a fine  
so that I can checkout books again*  

## Maximum Checkouts
*As a librarian  
I want a patron to only be able to checkout up to 10 books at a time  
so that they don't unfairly hog the library's resources*
